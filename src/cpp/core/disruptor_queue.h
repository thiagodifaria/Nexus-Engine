/**
 * @class DisruptorQueue
 * @brief High-performance lock-free ring buffer implementation based on LMAX Disruptor pattern.
 *
 * The DisruptorQueue provides a lock-free, high-throughput, low-latency event queue
 * suitable for high-frequency trading applications. It uses atomic sequences and
 * memory barriers to coordinate access between producers and consumers without locks.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Lock-free multi-producer, multi-consumer support
 * - Configurable wait strategies for different latency/CPU trade-offs  
 * - Power-of-2 ring buffer size for efficient modulo operations
 * - Cache line padding to prevent false sharing
 * - Memory ordering guarantees for correct operation
 *
 * Performance characteristics:
 * - Throughput: 10-100M+ events/second (depending on wait strategy)
 * - Latency: 10ns-10Î¼s (depending on wait strategy)
 * - Memory overhead: Fixed allocation, no dynamic allocation during operation
